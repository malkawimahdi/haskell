module Week4 where

-- Everything within a list have to have the same type.

-- Can't modify a value contained within a list. 

-- Any type with square brackets around them such as [Int] denote that it is a list of the type.

-- You do not have to declare the length of the lists in Haskell. 

-- Strings are lists of characters in Haskell.

-- A list can contain ANYTHING that is OF THE SAME type. E.g. ["Hello","world""] :: [[Char]]. 
                                                           --  [div, (+), (*)] :: [Int -> Int -> Int]
                                                           -- "" :: [Char]

-- Any list is greater than the empty list. compare "a" "" = GT. Uses lexigraphical comparison to determine the properties of LT, EQ, GT.

-- Strings are another name for [Char], so String = [Char].
